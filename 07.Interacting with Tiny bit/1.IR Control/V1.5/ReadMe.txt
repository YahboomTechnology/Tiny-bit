!!!Note:
1. This experiment needs to be done indoors to reduce the interference of sunlight on the infrared receiver.
2. Since there are always some problems with the infrared expansion package, and Microbit has not solved this problem.

Case1: If you are using the Microbit V1 board, please use the hex file provided by us directly, and do not open the hex file in the MakeCode graphical programming interface, otherwise it will cause some errors, and the infrared remote control function cannot be realized.

Case2: If you are using a Microbit V2 board, you can use this expansion pack. https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Yahboom_IR_V2 and https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Tiny-bitLib
