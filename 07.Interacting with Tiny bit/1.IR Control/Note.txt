Note:

1) This experiment needs to be done indoors to reduce the interference of sunlight on the infrared receiver.

2) Before using the infrared remote control, you need to remove the plastic piece at the rear of the remote controller.

3) During use, the infrared remote controller needs to point to the infrared receiver head directly in front of the car.
